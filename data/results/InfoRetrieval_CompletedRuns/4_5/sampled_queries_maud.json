It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, subject to the limitations in Section 8.02(d)(i), Section 8.02(d)(ii) and Section 9.10(b), the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause each other Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 9.11 without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable or not appropriate for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

Except as it may relate to an Excluded Party, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours thereof) notify in writing Parent of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start Date, which notice shall include a copy of any such Acquisition Proposal made in writing and any other written terms and proposals provided (including financing commitments) to the Company or its Representatives and a written summary of material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in writing. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal including any material changes in respect of any such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement to allow for a confidential Acquisition Proposal to be made to the Company or the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) so long as the Company promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours thereof) notifies Parent thereof after granting any such waiver, amendment or release and, if requested by Parent, grants Parent an equivalent waiver, amendment or release under the Confidentiality Agreement, if applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the commencement of the No-Shop Period Start Date, until the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 6.1(a) with respect to any Excluded Party so long as such Excluded Party remains an Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended or modified Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the restrictions in this Section 6.1(b) shall not apply with respect thereto. \n\n\n"

Subject to the foregoing and Section 6.9(c) below, the Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted on or before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Parent with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable Law, to (i) enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality or similar agreement. The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, of any discussions or negotiations that are sought to be initiated or continued or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent promptly apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of any such request, inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal, or all amendments or proposed amendments thereto) on a current basis (it being understood that no such communications to Parent shall be deemed a Company Adverse Change of Recommendation). The Company agrees that it shall contemporaneously provide to Parent any confidential or nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be provided to any other Person in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal which has not previously been provided to Parent.

AB agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries will, and AB will direct and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to initiate, solicit, encourage or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to shareholders of AB) with respect to an Acquisition Event (any such proposal or offer, an “Acquisition Proposal”) or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; except that, in the event AB receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal and the board of directors of AB determines prior to approval of this Agreement and the Merger by AB’s shareholders at the AB Meeting, in good faith and after consultation with independent legal counsel, that (a) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (b) fiduciary duties applicable to it require it to engage in negotiations with, provide confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with a Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, AB may do so to the extent the board of directors of AB determines it is required by its fiduciary duties. In such event, prior to providing any confidential information or data to any such Person, AB and such Person shall have executed a confidentiality agreement on terms at least as favorable to AB as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. AB will further notify GBCI in writing promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with AB, or if any such inquiry, proposal or request is thereafter materially modified or amended, including providing to GBCI the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or inquiry in connection with each required notice, together with a copy of any written proposals received (it being understood that the name of Person making the Acquisition Proposal may be redacted from the copy of the written proposal provided to GBCI). AB will take the necessary steps to inform the appropriate individuals or entities referred to in the second sentence of this Section 4.1.9 of the obligations to be undertaken in this Section 4.1.9. Nothing contained in this Section 4.1.9 shall prohibit AB or the board of directors of AB from complying with AB’s obligations required under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the board of directors of AB’s recommendation that AB’s shareholders approve this Agreement and the Merger unless the board of directors of AB reaffirms such recommendation in such disclosure. \n\n\n"
