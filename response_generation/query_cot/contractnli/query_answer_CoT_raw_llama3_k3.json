The NDA does not explicitly mention whether verbally conveyed information is considered Confidential Information.\n\nHowever, considering the restrictions outlined in the NDA, we can infer that verbally conveyed information might not be considered Confidential Information. The NDA states that Confidential Information shall not include any information that:\n\n- is known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party;\n- is rightfully known to the Receiving Party without restriction on disclosure from a third party;\n- is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information;\n- is or becomes generally known to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;\n- is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party authorized to disclose it.\n\nSince the definition of Confidential Information does not explicitly include verbally conveyed information, and the restrictions mentioned in the NDA suggest that information must be explicitly stated as Confidential Information or meet certain criteria to be considered confidential, we can conclude that verbally conveyed information may not be considered Confidential Information under the terms of the NDA.
