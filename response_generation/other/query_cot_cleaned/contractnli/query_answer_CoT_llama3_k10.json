The NDA allows PMS to disclose Confidential Information in response to a Canadian judicial or other legal binding Canadian governmental order, provided that PMS gives IBC reasonable notice to seek a protective order or equivalent.3.

However, based on the NDA, PMS is bound by the terms and conditions outlined in the NDA, including those related to third-party software code.

The question asks about the Receiving Party's rights regarding reverse engineering. In the context, we find the following relevant information:1. The terms of confidentiality under the Agreement do not limit either party's right to independently develop or acquire products without using the other party's Confidential Information.2. The Receiving Party agrees to segregate all Confidential Materials from the confidential materials of others to prevent accidental disclosure.3. Confidential Information shall not include any information that is already known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure or becomes known to the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction.Considering these points, the Receiving Party is allowed to use the Confidential Information for their business relationship with the Disclosing Party, but reverse engineering is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we can only infer that reverse engineering is not explicitly prohibited by the NDA. However, the Receiving Party agrees to segregate Confidential Materials from other confidential materials to prevent accidental disclosure. So, the answer to the question is:{  thought: The context does not explicitly mention reverse engineering, but the agreement requires the Receiving Party to segregate Confidential Materials from other confidential materials to prevent accidental disclosure.,  answer: The NDA does not explicitly prohibit reverse engineering, but the Receiving Party must segregate Confidential Materials from other confidential materials to prevent accidental disclosure.",
