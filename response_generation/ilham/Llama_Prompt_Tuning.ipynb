The document states that the Receiving Party may independently develop information that is similar to the Confidential Information, provided that such information is not derived from the Confidential Information. This means that the Receiving Party may develop information that is similar to the Confidential Information, but only if it is not derived from the Confidential Information. In other words, the Receiving Party may develop information that is similar to the Confidential Information, but only if it is not based on or derived from the Confidential Information. This is a common provision in non-disclosure agreements, as it allows the Receiving Party to develop information that is similar to the Confidential Information, but only if it is not derived from the Confidential Information. This provision is intended to protect the Confidential Information and prevent the Receiving Party from using the Confidential Information to develop similar information. However, it also allows the Receiving Party to develop information that is similar to the Confidential Information, as long as it is not derived from the Confidential Information. This provision is intended to balance the interests of both parties and ensure that the Confidential Information is protected while still allowing the Receiving Party to develop similar information. In conclusion, the document allows the Receiving Party to independently develop information that is similar to the Confidential Information, provided that such information is not derived from the Confidential Information. This provision is intended to protect the Confidential Information and prevent the Receiving Party from using the Confidential Information to develop similar information, while still allowing the Receiving Party to develop information that is similar to the Confidential Information, as long as it is not derived from the Confidential Information.\n",
