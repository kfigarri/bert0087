However, the clause mentions certain conditions that may lead to termination of the Agreement. Specifically, it mentions:\n\n* Termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), which requires the payment of the Company Termination Fee.\n* Termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8, which also requires the payment of the Parent Termination Fee.\n\nAdditionally, the clause mentions that if the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Purchaser Parties fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee, when due, a suit may be commenced to obtain such payment, which could result in a judgment against the Company or a Purchaser Party.\n\nIt is important to note that the clause does not explicitly state the Fiduciary Termination Right Triggers, but rather provides conditions that may lead to termination of the Agreement. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific triggers for termination based on this clause alone.\n\nKey phrases from the clause that support this answer include:\n\n* \"provided, however, that the Company shall concurrently with, and as a condition of, such termination, pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i)\"\n* \"if this Agreement is validly terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent concurrently with, and as a condition of, such termination, the Company Termination Fee\"\n* \"In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Purchaser Parties shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee, when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, a Purchaser Party or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company or a Purchaser Party, as applicable, for any amount set forth in this Section 8\"",

However, we can infer some information from the clause.\n\nThe clause states that the termination fee payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b) is paid to Parent in accordance with Section 8.5(b), and this payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser in respect of any breach of, or inaccuracy contained in, the Company's covenants, agreements, representations or warranties in this Agreement.\n\nHowever, the clause also provides a condition for the termination right to be available, which is that the party seeking termination must have complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement, including Section 6.\n\nTherefore, to answer the user's question, the Fiduciary Termination Right Triggers for termination are not explicitly stated, but it appears that the termination right is only available if the party seeking termination has complied with its obligations under the Agreement, including Section 6.\n\nKey phrases from the clause that support this answer are:\n\n* \"the termination fee payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b) is paid to Parent in accordance with Section 8.5(b)\"\n* \"Parent's receipt of the termination fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser in respect of any breach of, or inaccuracy contained in, the Company's covenants, agreements, representations or warranties in this Agreement\"\n* \"provided, however, that this termination right is not available (i) to any party unless such party has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement, including Section 6\"\n\nNote that the clause does not provide a direct answer to the user's question, but rather provides conditions and restrictions for the termination right.",
