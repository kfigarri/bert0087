The section is titled \"Covenants\" and specifically mentions \"Conduct of the Company\" in Article 7.1.\n\nArticle 7.1 states:\n\n\"7.1 Conduct of the Company. The Company shall conduct its business in the ordinary course of business and shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, take any action that is outside the ordinary course of business or that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.\"\n\nFrom this clause, we can infer that the Ordinary course of business covenants refer to the Company's commitment to conduct its business in the usual and customary manner, without taking any extraordinary or unusual actions that could have a significant impact on its operations or financial condition.\n\nIn other words, the Company is obligated to maintain business as usual and not engage in any activities that are outside the norm for its industry or business. This covenant is intended to ensure that the Company continues to operate in a stable and predictable manner, without taking any actions that could potentially harm its business or reputation.\n\nKey phrases from the clause that support this answer include:\n\n* \"conduct its business in the ordinary course of business\"\n* \"without the prior written consent of Parent\"\n* \"that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect\"\n\nThese phrases emphasize the importance of the Company's commitment to maintaining its usual business practices and avoiding any actions that could have a significant impact on its operations or financial condition.",

        "response":"Based on the provided Retrieved Chunk and the user's question, I'll analyze the clause related to \"Intentional Breach\" and provide an answer.\n\nThe user's question is about what happens during a breach of the No-Shop clause in the Acquisition Agreement between Electronic Arts Inc. (Parent) and Glu Mobile Inc. (Target).\n\nThe clause defining \"Intentional Breach\" does not directly address the consequences of a breach of the No-Shop clause. However, we can infer some information from this clause.\n\nAn \"Intentional Breach\" is described as an intentional act or omission taken with the actual knowledge that such action or omission constitutes, or would result in, a breach of a representation, warranty, agreement, or covenant.\n\nIn the context of the Acquisition Agreement, a breach of the No-Shop clause would likely be considered an intentional breach if the Target (Glu Mobile Inc.) intentionally engages in activities that violate the No-Shop clause, such as negotiating with another party or entering into a new agreement, despite being aware that this would breach the agreement.\n\nHowever, the clause does not specify the consequences of an intentional breach. It is essential to review the Acquisition Agreement as a whole to understand the remedies available to the parties in the event of a breach of the No-Shop clause.\n\nIn summary, while the clause defining \"Intentional Breach\" provides insight into the nature of an intentional breach, it does not explicitly state what happens during a breach of the No-Shop clause. To determine the consequences of a breach, it is necessary to examine the Acquisition Agreement in its entirety.\n\nKey phrases from the clause that support this answer:\n\n* \"Intentional act or omission\"\n* \"Actual knowledge\"\n* \"Breach of such representation, warranty, agreement or covenant\"",

This means that the Target should not deviate significantly from its usual business practices, and any changes or deviations should be reasonable and justified.\n\nIn summary, the ordinary course of business covenants in the Acquisition Agreement require the Target to conduct its business in a manner that is consistent with its past practices, which is deemed to be the ordinary course of business.\n\nKey phrases from the clause that support this answer include:\n\n* \"The words 'ordinary course of business' shall be deemed to be followed by the words 'consistent with past practice'\"\n* \"consistent with past practice\"\n\nNote that this answer is based on the specific language of the clause and does not assume or infer any additional information.",
