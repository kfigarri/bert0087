The agreement also specifies that the recipient shall use the Confidential Information solely for the intended purpose and not for any other use without the discloser's prior written consent.\n\nIn this context, the question asks whether verbally conveyed information can be considered as Confidential Information under the agreement. Given the definition of Confidential Information in the agreement, it appears that verbal information could potentially be considered Confidential Information if it is identified as such at the time of disclosure and subsequently confirmed in writing within fourteen days. However, the specifics of the agreement do not explicitly mention verbal information. Therefore, while the agreement may encompass verbal information, it is not explicitly stated that verbally conveyed information is considered Confidential Information. \n\nTo provide a definitive answer, it would be necessary to review the full text of the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement between IPTK and CO, focusing on the specific provisions related to the definition of Confidential Information and the conditions under which it can be considered.",
