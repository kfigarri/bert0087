We need to analyze the context to determine if the university is allowed to share confidential information with these parties without the prior consent of the student and the contractual partner.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Non-Disclosure Agreement between the university and the student\/contractual partner establishes that the contracting parties agree not to make available confidential information to third parties without prior consent. Since the university is a contracting party in this agreement, it is crucial to consider the following:\n\n1. The university is bound by the terms of the agreement, which prohibits it from sharing confidential information with third parties without the prior consent of the student and the contractual partner.\n2. The university is the Receiving Party in this agreement, meaning it is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the shared information.\n3.
