The answer is implicit in the definition of Confidential Information. The clause does not explicitly state that the Agreement does not grant rights to the Confidential Information, but it does specify that Confidential Information does not include information already known or independently developed by Mentor prior to the disclosure.\n\nIn other words, the clause implies that the Receiving Party (Mentor) does not have any rights to the Confidential Information, as it is excluded from the definition of Confidential Information. This is because the Confidential Information is only related to ideas and information disclosed to Mentor, and not to information that Mentor already knew or developed independently.\n\nKey phrases supporting this answer include:\n\n* \"Confidential Information does not include: information already known or independently developed by Mentor prior to the disclosure of any Idea;\"\n* \"Confidential Information\" is defined as any Idea disclosed to Mentor, and so on.\n\nIn summary, the Non-Disclosure Agreement between CopAcc and ToP Mentors implies that the Receiving Party (Mentor) does not have any rights to the Confidential Information, as it is excluded from the definition of Confidential Information.",
