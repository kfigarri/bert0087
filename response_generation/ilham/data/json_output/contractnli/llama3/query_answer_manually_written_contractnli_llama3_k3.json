Mentor agrees to notify Organizer immediately in writing if they become aware of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information: This shows that ToP Mentors have a responsibility to promptly inform the Organizer if they discover any unauthorized use or misuse of Confidential Information.\n3.
