The clause mainly focuses on the restrictions and obligations regarding the handling, use, and disclosure of Confidential Information shared between the State of Illinois (referred as \"State\") and the Vendor (referred as \"Vendor\"). \n\n\nThe clause states that the Vendor shall use the Confidential Information solely for discussing and evaluating the State's fiber optic network project and shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the State's prior written consent. If the Vendor acquires Confidential Information from a third party, they must ensure that the information is not related to the State's fiber optic network project and is not covered by any non-disclosure agreement with the State.\n\n\nIn summary, the document allows the Vendor to acquire Confidential Information from a third party, but only if the information does not interfere with the State's interests or violate any non-disclosure agreement with the State.
