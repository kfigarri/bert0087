In the absence of an explicit anti-assignment clause, the default rule in contract law is that a party can generally assign their rights, obligations, or interests under a contract without the consent of the other party.

        "response":"To determine if there is an anti-assignment clause in the Distributorship Agreement between Signature Orthopaedics Pty Ltd and CPM Medical Consultants LLC, let's examine the document carefully.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided Exhibit 10.43, I cannot find an explicit anti-assignment clause mentioned. However, I can provide some insights on the general terms and conditions related to assignment of the agreement.\n\nThe agreement is dated March 29, 2018, and involves the distribution of medical products between Signature Orthopaedics Pty Ltd and CPM Medical Consultants LLC.\n\nThe agreement does not explicitly state an anti-assignment clause, which means that the contract allows for the possibility of assignment without any restrictions. However, it is essential to consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Section 11.1 of the agreement mentions that the agreement may be amended or modified by mutual agreement of both parties. This provision could potentially imply that the parties involved can agree to impose restrictions on assignment in the future.\n\n2. Section 15.2 states that the agreement may be terminated by either party upon written notice. This section does not explicitly mention assignment, but termination could potentially lead to the need for renegotiation of any rights, obligations, or terms related to assignment.\n\nPlease note that the absence of an explicit anti-assignment clause does not necessarily mean that assignment is allowed or prohibited. It is crucial to consult the entire agreement and consider the context of the clauses mentioned above before concluding whether an anti-assignment clause exists or not. ",
