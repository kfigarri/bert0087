Viber uses end-to-end encryption for its core features, which include one-on-one messages, group messages, and secondary devices. This means that the content of your messages is protected by encryption and can only be accessed by the sender and recipient.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that when you post information on public features of Viber, such as Communities, the admin of the Community has the ability to control who can access the messages. If the admin allows everyone to access the messages, then they will be visible to all members of the Community. Additionally, when you share information on public platforms outside of Viber, such as social media or third-party applications, Viber cannot guarantee the security of your messages as they are not under its control.\n\nIn summary, messages sent within Viber's core features, like one-on-one messages, group messages, and secondary devices, are generally secure due to end-to-end encryption. But be cautious when sharing information in public features or on external platforms, as Viber cannot guarantee the security of your messages in those cases. ",
