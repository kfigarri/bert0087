The agreement clearly states that the Recipient may not make any use of the Confidential Information received from the Discloser without the Discloser's prior written consent. This means that the Recipient is not allowed to acquire information similar to the Confidential Information from a third party without the Discloser's explicit permission.\n\nThe agreement also highlights the importance of confidentiality and non-disclosure by stating that the Recipient must cause each of its employees, officers, agents, affiliates, and attorneys who have access to the Confidential Information to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement containing terms at least as stringent as those contained in the agreement. This further reinforces the idea that the Recipient is not allowed to disclose or use the Confidential Information without proper authorization.\n\nIn summary, the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement between IPTK and CO strictly prohibits the Recipient from acquiring information similar to the Confidential Information from a third party without the Discloser's prior written consent."
