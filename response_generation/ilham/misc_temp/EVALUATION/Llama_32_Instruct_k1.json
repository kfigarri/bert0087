Therefore, the answer is that the document does not explicitly prohibit the Receiving Party from independently developing information similar to the Confidential Information.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the Receiving Party's obligations under this clause may still be subject to other contractual or legal requirements.

This implies that the Receiving Party is expected to take steps to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information to unauthorized parties, including third parties. However, the Agreement does not provide explicit permission for the Receiving Party to acquire such information from a third party. Therefore, the answer is that the document does not allow the Receiving Party to acquire information similar to the Confidential Information from a third party. \n\nKey phrase: \"utilizes reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that the person receiving such Confidential Information will maintain the confidentiality of the same\" \n\nNote: The clause does not explicitly address the scenario of acquiring information from a third party, but it does emphasize the importance of maintaining confidentiality. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Receiving Party should not acquire such information from a third party without the prior consent of the disclosing party. However, this inference is not explicitly stated in the clause. \n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification. \n\n### Additional Information:\nHNBA stands for the Hong Kong National Bar Association. The Confidentiality Agreement is a common document used in the legal profession to protect sensitive information shared between parties. The clause in question is likely intended to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, but it does not explicitly address the scenario of acquiring such information from a third party. \n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification or if you would like me to elaborate on any aspect of the answer. \n\n### Final Answer:\nThe HNBA's Confidentiality Agreement does not explicitly permit the Receiving Party to acquire information similar to the Confidential Information from a third party.
